# Spark_Mini-Project1
### Description
This repository contains four files:
1. ```Main_Spark.py``` - Python script.
2. ```final_solution.txt``` - Text file with with the solution.
3. ```execution_report.log``` - Execution report of the Spark job running locally.
4. ```spark_mp_data.csv``` - CSV File with the initial data.

In this project I used Spark  to complete the same map reduce job from my prior hadoop mini-project. Not only did I learnhow to implement pysparks nuances, but i learned that Spark is much faster and easier to use than hadoop. 

To successfully run this Mini-Project, I needed to ensure that the Spark jar files where located  in the right directory.
In addition, make I had to make sure that ```pyspark``` is installed to use with IDE.

### How to run:
First make sure you are in the same directory sas this python file then run the command:
```
spark-submit Final_Autoinc_Spark.py
```
